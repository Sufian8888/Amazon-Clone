# Amazon-Clone
"Thanks to Allah Almighty".  I'm excited to share my latest project: a basic Amazon clone built using HTML and CSS! 
This project showcases my skills in:

- HTML structure and semantic markup
- CSS styling and layout
- Building a responsive and user-friendly interface

Note: This project is for educational purposes only and not intended for commercial use."

Feel free to customize it as per your needs!
